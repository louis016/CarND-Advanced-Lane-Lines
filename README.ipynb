    "1. The results of perspective transform will lead the pipeline fail to detect the right curved lane.\n",
    "2. The window margin width and mini_pixel numbers will lead the pipeline fail to detec the lane. If the width is too big, the window will including pixels which are not part of the lane and will get the wrong ploynomial fit.\n",
    "3. The choice of gradient and color threshold is also a key factor that will influence the detected results.\n",

    "1. Dynamically selecting threshold parameters based on the resulting number of activated pixels"
